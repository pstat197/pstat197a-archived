::: {.column width="50%"}
The [Caves lab](https://caves-lab.eemb.ucsb.edu/) studies visual acuity and its evolutionary and ecological drivers in animals. Bees are great model organisms for studying the relationship between ecology and acuity due to wide variation in lifestyles and ecologies.

-   ***Project:*** measuring visual acuity in bees from high-resolution images

    -   acuity quantification is derived from physical measurements that could potentially be inferred from photographs rather than measured directly

    -   specifically, radius of curvature of the eye and width of ommatidia (compound eye facets)

-   ***Goals:*** utilize computer vision techniques to infer acuity measurements from photographs and merge with ecological data to explore correlates

## CCBER

The Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration (CCBER) contributes to the [Big Bee Project](http://big-bee.net/), aimed at creating \>1M 2D and 3D high-resolution images of bees for the study of anatomical variation.

. . .

***Project***: constructing three-dimensional bee models from high-resolution images

-   several software tools for constructing 3D models from 2D images are available, but performance with bees specifically is not well understood

-   several image sets of \~100 photographs each are available for construction of models

. . .

***Goals:*** after receiving training on 3D modeling tools, students will experiment with parameter tuning for optimal rendering of bee models; students will then derive physical measurements from the models.

## Climate Hazards Center

The [Climate Hazards Center](https://www.chc.ucsb.edu/) housed in the geography department is a multidisciplinary research center focusing on climate risk analysis and response.

. . .

***Project 1:*** identifying the drivers of food insecurity in the developing world

-   precipitation and potential evapotranspiration together can help identify deficits in available water and risk of food shortages

-   explore the relationship between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration globally over time and identify drivers after accounting for relationship

. . .

***Project 2:*** evaluating and validating station- and satellite-based daily precipitation datasets

-   CHC supports [precipitation datasets](https://chc.ucsb.edu/data/chirps) based on interpolating measurements from satellites and ground stations

-   new data releases go through an evaluation/validation process with benchmarking data prior to release

-   students will carry out evaluation/validation of a new release based on [prior strategies](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201566#Sec11)

## EEMB/Patrick Green
