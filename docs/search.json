    "text": "Basic Git actions\nHere you’ll make a local change and then push that change to the remote repository.\n\nPull\nAs discussed in the pre-lab activity, the first step to making a change is beginning with the most up-to-date version of the repository files. Your TA will have made a small change to the repository since you first cloned it, so we’ll start with retrieving that change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\n\nPull changes from the remote repository:\n\nIn your GitHub client, open the sandbox repository and then look for a ‘Pull’ menu item.\nIn the terminal: navigate to the root directory of the repository and git pull\n\nTechnically, git pull = git fetch + git merge. If you ever wish to examine changes without modifying local files, you can git fetch.\n\n\nExamine the updated local repository files; notice that there is now a folder named after your lab section containing a markdown file. Open it up and have a look.\n\n\nMake changes\nNow that you have the most up-to-date version of all files, create a new markdown file in your lab section folder with a fun fact about you (or anything else if you’d rather) that you’ll upload to the repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\n\nCreate a markdown file:\n\nIn RStudio, select File > New File > Markdown File\nAdd an ‘About Me’ or similar header (use one or more hashes # before the header text)\nWrite a fun fact about yourself\nSave the file in your lab folder as YOURGITHUBUSERNAME-about.md\n\n\n\n\n\nStage and commit changes\nNow that your new file is ready to go you can stage the changes to be committed to the repository and create a commit.\nA commit is a bundle of changes that will be submitted to the repository along with a message briefly explaining the changes made. Your GitHub client will often fill in a default message such as ‘update FILENAME.EXT’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\n\nStage and commit:\n\nIn your client, look for a menu item to add or stage changes. By default any changes made to any file will be included.\n\nOr in the terminal: git add FILENAME\n\nOnce you have staged changes, look for a menu item to commit changes. Add a message and commit the changes.\n\nOr in the terminal: git add -m \"your message here\"\n\n\n\n\nOften these actions are performed together. However, in some workflows it may make sense to stage changes incrementally and create commits that bundle several changes at once. For example, if you need to make an update that requires modifying files A, B, and C, it may make sense to edit and stage changes to A first, followed by B, followed by C, and create the commit only once the full update has been implemented.\n\n\nPush\nThe last step is to push your commit to the remote repository. However, as you will see in a moment, too many people trying to push changes at once can create some problems.\nYour TA will instruct someone in your class to push their changes. The very first person to do this will have no problems, since their local repository is up to date with the remote.\nYour TA will then instruct someone else to try. But since the first person modified the remote repository, the next person to push changes will no longer be up to date. Git will detect this and the push won’t go through. The person must update their local repository first, preferably by git pull.\nUnder the hood, the update action will merge the first person’s commit with the second person’s local repository. Git is fairly good at doing this in such a way that changes don’t get lost or overwritten, but there are some conflicts that it can’t resolve automatically. That will happen if multiple changes are made to the same line of the same file.\nIn this activity everyone is working on independent files and there’s no overlap between changes, so although it would be a bit messy to have everyone pull/push sequentially, in principle it could be done. However, there is a more efficient way to work in parallel: by creating branches."

If you’ve already used RStudio, great – this will still serve to introduce you to how we’ll use RStudio projects in this class.\n\nRStudio Setup\n\nYour TA will briefly review the (default) layout of the RStudio IDE. You should be able to identify/find the following:\n\nconsole\nterminal\nfile navigator\nenvironment\nhistory\n\nWe’ll use several R packages throughout the quarter. Some of these we will install on the go, but we can install several that we’ll rely on now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\n\nInstall packages\nNavigate to the console and copy-paste the following commands.

When you create a project in a directory on your local machine, RStudio keeps track of project metadata, history, and the working environment so that every time you open the project you see whatever you had open when you last closed it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\n\nCreate a new project:\n\nSelect File > New project\nCreate the project in a new directory as a subdirectory of your class folder\nName it something like example-project\n\nComment: when naming files it’s good practice to avoid spaces, special characters, and the like. A naming convention we try to follow: choose a descriptive name comprising 1-3 words or common abbreviations separated by hyphens.\n\n\nTake a moment to observe the file navigator. It should consist of a single example-project.Rproj file.\n\n\nAdd content\nWe may as well populate the project with a few files – so let’s add a dataset and write a short script, as if we’re just starting a data analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\n\nRetrieve data and store a local copy\n\nOpen a new script: File > New File > R Script\nIn the navigator, create a folder called data and a folder called scripts\nCopy and paste the code chunk below into your script.\nExecute once, then save in the scripts folder as data-retrieval.R and close\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# retrieve pollution data\nurl <- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pstat197/pstat197a/main/materials/labs/lab1-setup/data/pollution.csv'\npollution <- read_csv(url)\n\n# write as csv to file\nwrite_csv(pollution, file = 'data/pollution.csv')\n\n# clear environment\nrm(list = ls())\n\n\nNext, we’ll do a simple regression analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\n\nCreate a script\n\nCreate a new script as before\nCopy-paste the code chunk below into your script\nExecute once and examine the results\nSave in the scripts folder as slr-analysis.R\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# load data\npollution <- read_csv('data/pollution.csv')\n\n# examine scatterplot with SLR fit\nggplot(pollution,\n       aes(x = log(SO2), y = Mort)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = 'lm')\n\n\n\n# compute SLR fit\nfit <- lm(Mort ~ log(SO2), data = pollution)\nbroom::tidy(fit)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 5\n  term        estimate std.error statistic  p.value\n  <chr>          <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>\n1 (Intercept)    887.      17.6      50.4  1.37e-49\n2 log(SO2)        16.7      4.99      3.35 1.40e- 3\n\n# interpret\nfit_ci <- confint(fit, parm = 'log(SO2)')*log(1.2)\n\npaste('With 95% confidence, every 20% increase in sulfur dioxide pollution is associated with an increase in two-year mortality rate between', \n      round(fit_ci[1], 2), \n      'and', \n      round(fit_ci[2], 2), \n      'per 100k', sep = ' ') %>% \n  print()\n\n[1] \"With 95% confidence, every 20% increase in sulfur dioxide pollution is associated with an increase in two-year mortality rate between 1.23 and 4.87 per 100k\"\n\n\n\nCongrats on your first project!

    "text": "GitHub repositories\n\n\nGit and GitHub\nAt some point in time – possibly quite recently – you had to install Git on your local machine, as well as create a GitHub account. So, Git and GitHub are two different things.\nGit is version control software that enables you to systematically track and control file changes within a repository – a collection of files possibly with some directory structure. (The definition of ‘repository’ is simply ‘storage place’.)\nGitHub is an online platform for hosting repositories remotely. Anyone with access to a repository can make changes to files in the repository, and this enables multiple people to collaborate on code.\n\n\nlocal <> remote\nUsually remote repositories are not updated directly because contributors need to execute codes to test their changes and the remote server that hosts the repository is not equipped to do this.\nInstead, contributors will prepare changes on their own machine where they can test them, and then update the remote repository once their changes are complete.\nThis process of implementing file changes in a repository involves communicating information between local and remote locations. For this purpose a local copy of the remote repository is needed.\n\n\nCloning a repository\nIn Git lingo, a clone is a local copy of a remote repository. Creating a clone copies files and establishes the link between local and remote repositories so that changes can be sent to and received from the remote repository. You only need to create a clone once.\nTo clone a repository, all one needs is:\n\nthe remote location URL;\nthe local destination where the clone will be created;\npermission from the repository owner, if private.\n\nI’ve created a ‘sandbox’ repository (for playing in) at https://github.com/pstat197/sandbox. It’s a public repository, so no special permissions are needed. Follow the link to see the repository contents in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\n\nClone the sandbox repository:\n\nOpen your GitHub client (GitKracken or GitHub Desktop or similar) and ensure you are logged in to your GitHub account.\nLook for a ‘Clone Repo’ menu item or similar and simply input the URL and the place you’d like to clone it; proceed through any prompts.\nCheck your file navigator to confirm that the repository files were copied.\n\n\n\n\nAn alternative possibility is to create the clone using a terminal command. In the terminal, navigate to the desired destination, and input:\ngit clone https://github.com/pstat197/sandbox\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemarks\n\n\n\nOn terminal commands:\n\nIt’s recommended to manage Git actions through a visual client, as it’s much easier to see and understand what’s happening.\nHowever, if you know exactly what you’re doing, executing simple actions via Git bash in the terminal can be more efficient at times.\nFor example, you can keep a terminal open in RStudio and manage your repository workflow from there, without having to toggle between environments.\nTry experimenting with terminal commands from RStudio after you have a little experience with basic Git actions."

Enrolled students should request an email invitation from course staff if they have not received one.\nTo join the organization students will need to create a GitHub account if they do not already have one. Here is some advice on choosing a username.\nStudents have write access to all repositories within the organization and the ability to create their own public or private repositories. Course staff have administrator privileges.\nAlthough the organization is invite-only, it is not private:\n\nrepositories for course modules are public, and anyone on the web can access them;\nprivate repositories remain visible to course staff.\n\nStudents are asked to submit work by contributing to repositories for course modules. Any such contributions would remain publicly visible. Students can elect to keep their work on a private fork if they prefer."
